# POLSCI-5

## Immigration by Region/Country Notes 7/2/19
- Need to figure out how to reformat the year 
- Need to find best ways to visualize plots -- currently too hard to read and the date range for pre-2008 crisis is off; also looks like the dates on the plot range from 1990+, but the data only goes from 1989-2017

## Civil Wars 7/2/19
- Cleaning data -- trying to figure out a way to change values (e.g. types of conflict) using datascience library? Seems more feasible using Pandas?
- Reformatting year --> Ravi found a way to do it, but when I group by that column the format reverts back to the original (overall dataset reformatting remains) 
- Can we and should we drop unecessary columns?
- The "Year" column is breaking down a war year-by-year 
- Some numbers are integers (e.g. "Years" column) while others are represented as strings (e.g. "Region") 
- Type of visualization wanted?
- Understanding differences between what columns stand for
