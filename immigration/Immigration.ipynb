Look at rows 14 through 20, which show the percentages for world regions.\n",

You can search for data sets related to immigration, and either download them and analyze them or analyze them right in your browser, after setting up an ICPSR account related to your Berkeley affiliation.\n",

    "\n",
    "> From the ICPSR home page, under Find Data, select Find Data. In the search box, enter immigration as your search term. On the next screen, under “Data Format”, select “online analysis”.  One of the top results (#8 as of 11-13-19) is “Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study”.  Click on the link with that title. Now you are in that dataset!  You can download it, and you’ll also see the tab for Data & Documentation.  But for now, click on the bar that says “Analyze Online”, and select “Full Analysis Capabilities” in the pop-up window.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Once you get past the login and permissions screens, click on the plus button to the left of the 2005 Youth Adaptation and Growth Questionnaire.  This will take you to that subsection of the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Now, by clicking on the plus buttons, you can see the questions asked in that year.  See if you can set up an analysis!  First, open the respondent demographics section, click on “State Current Residence”, and then on the top left, click on “Row” where it says “Copy To”.  Repeat this for the section called “Civil Status and Political Preference”, selecting the variable “Respondent Citizenship Status” and then on the buttons above clicking on “Column” next to “Copy To”.   On the right side of the screen, you will now be able to give your table a title (“Test” is fine!) and click on the “Run the Table” button.   The table you get will be a little confusing—What is ae and ap in the list of states? (you will need to look at documentation)  Why are there so many cells with small numbers, but lots for California and Florida? (look at the title of the study)  So many questions!  This is the world of data! \n",
